Solutions and tentative standings are out. You have until Thursday, April 8th at 11.59 PM to dispute any parts of our scoring. Please look over the solutions and check our numbers, particularly if you’re currently winning an award or are close to winning an award! 

The challenge period is mainly to ensure that our calculations have been correct. Things that you can (and should) dispute are

- If we misrecorded your HackerRank score or the timestamp of your last submitted answer.
- If you believe you should win the code golf prize because your submissions averaged fewer than 65 characters per correct submission. 
- If on problems 7 or 8 your believe your solution met a criteria on the rubric and we didn’t give you the points it deserved. For example: you came up with an O(N^2) solution for problem 7(iii) and we only gave you 3 points instead of 5.
- If you think a proof you submitted to problem 8 is correct, but we did not mark it as correct. However, know that we took quite a bit of time looking at each proof — especially if we couldn’t see why it was correct — so it’s unlikely that you will recuperate points here. But if you’re sure, then reach out!

Things that we will not be open to dispute:

- The points we awarded for partially correct solutions on the written problems. For example, we will not be changing the fact that an O(N^3) solution for problem 7(iii) got three points out of ten.
- Who the most inquisitive team and the raffle prize winner were.

We encourage you to look over the solutions even if you weren’t close to winning and reach out if you have any questions or are just interested in learning more. For every coding problem, we have at least a C++ and Java solution (and sometimes a Python solution), so you should feel free to run those and study how they work if you’re interested. COSCON’s primary goal, after all, is to help you explore new challenges in computer science and learn!
